This course is an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies and their application to the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts. The course provides a survey of current technologies that are used in the field of computational linguistics while using Spanish for the application of NLP tools. The class is designed to allow you to gradually develop simple programming skills in Linux/Mac command line and Python for text processing that will allow you to learn a set of 21st century skills in NLP in high demand for your future career choice in academia or industry.

The course has four general components. **First**, the basic practical skills for text processing in Linux Command Line and Python will be introduced using Spanish texts. The basics of programming will be covered with in-class exercises. In addition, sections of two online courses in [*LinkedIn Learning at MNSU*](https://www.mnsu.edu/it-solutions/help-support/linkedinlearning_training/) will be assigned. These basic aspects of programming will be necessary for your to understand how to run NLP programs.

**Next**, the class will delve into the *Python Natural Language Toolkit* (NLTK) and *spaCy*, two libraries used for common NLP tasks (e.g., sentence segmentation, word tokenization, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition, and text classification). We will also explore my new application [*SEÑAL*](https://señal.io) for analyzing second language Spanish essays.

**Then**, we will analyze the sentiment of students' comments. Here, you can use comments from your own class or from other professional source (e.g., client's reviews) and then add the analysis into your teaching portfolio or other types of professional reports.

 **Finally**, you will work towards extracting and creating your own annotated corpus of Spanish. Here you will learn how to extract Spanish data from *Twitter*. With the annotated corpus you will develop a machine learning Application.  

## Course Objectives
On completion of the course, you should be able to:
-	feel comfortable using elementary commands in Linux for text processing
-	conduct basic coding in Python and use Jupyter Notebook (an interactive computational environment for language programming).
-	display a familiarization of NLTK and spaCy for NLP tasks
- envision the use of SEÑAL for assessing language development
-	use a sentiment analyzer for adding relevant information to your professional documents
-	extract data from Twitter
- conceptualize a machine learning text classification system for a Spanish application

Student success relating to these objectives will be assessed on (tentative and subject to revision):
1.	**Lab assignments (x3)**: These assignments will require you to implement already-prepared computational algorithms on Spanish datasets and explore potential improvements and applications.  
2. **Teaching Portfolio**: you will use a sentiment analyzer to extract relevant information from students' comments.
3. **NLP Application**: you will extract a Spanish corpus for developing an NLP application. The project consists of two parts. First, you will create an annotated dataset of Spanish with data from Twitter (I can also provide other datasets). Think about an idea in which you can use what you have learned in the class to find a solution to an interesting phenomenon in the Spanish language. Then, you will present to the class the development of your own machine learning classifier. There are three ML classifiers you can choose from:
    1. topic classification: classify a text based on a topic or relevance
    2. sentiment analysis: detect positive, negative or neutral sentiment in a text.
    3. intent classification: classification based on the purpose of the illocutionary act: complaint, request, feedback, etc.

## Class Meetings
**Mondays and Wednesdays 7-9pm (CDT)** <br />
The course runs from May 16 to June 17, 2022.

- Zoom Link is available in D2L

## Programming Component on LinkedIn Learning
As a MNSU student you have free access to LinkedIn Learning. Sign in firt with your StarID before clicking on the links below. The following are two short introductory courses that will help you get started on programming languages and Python.

1. [Fundamentals of Programming Languages ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-fundamentals/what-is-programming?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=57684185) - Section 1: Programming Basics
2. [Python for Non-Programmers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-non-programmers/). Sections 1, 2 & 3. After that, work at your own pace and complete as many modules as you want.

## Extraction of Twitter Corpora
On Week 4, we will learn how to extract Twitter corpora for our project. Please register as a researcher in advance for obtaining access to Twitter API.
- Twitter Developer API: [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)
